# GAP

The official scoring program for hang gliding and paragliding competitions is
[FS](http://fs.fai.org/). Its principal output for a competition task is an
html table of pilot scores. In addition to the day's scores, there are columns
in this table for the time on course, the distance flown and for the breakdown
of the scored points among distance points, lead points, time points and
arrival points.

Looking for examples? There is a good archive of past Forbes Flatlands
[competition results](http://www.forbesflatlands.com/results/past-results), for
instance results for [task
1](https://www.forbesflatlands.com/results-show?id_results=7&db=results2013&class=results_open)
of the 19th World Hang Gliding Champs.

Commission Internationale de Vol Libre (CIVL - Hang Gliding and Paragliding
Commission) is an Air Sport Commission (ASC) of the Fédération Internationale
Aéronautique (FAI). CIVL produce FS. It is the work of paid and volunteer
developers.

The scoring method is [well
documented](http://fs.fai.org/trac/wiki/ScoringFormulas). Principal documents
are;

* [Sporting Code Section 7A - Annex
  GAP](https://www.fai.org/sites/default/files/documents/sporting_code_s7a-xc-civl_gap_annex_1.pdf)
  - The definitive guide produced and maintained by CIVL.
* [GAP
  2002](http://fs.fai.org/trac/raw-attachment/wiki/ScoringFormulas/GAP02_en.pdf)
  - A much shorter and less formal guide that is a good first read to gain an
  understanding of why GAP is needed and how it works.
