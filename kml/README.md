# `flight-kml`

Provides parsing of dumped tracklogs. In hang gliding and paragliding
competitions when [FS](http://fs.fai.org/) and [GpsDump](http://www.gpsdump.no)
are paired in competition mode a pilot's tracklog is dumped as
[KML](https://developers.google.com/kml/). This is exlained in detail on the
[FS wiki](http://fs.fai.org/trac/wiki/GpsDump/).
