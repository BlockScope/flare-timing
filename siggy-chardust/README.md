# `siggy-chardust`

Rounding rationals to significant digits and decimal places.

The 'round' function from the prelude returns an integer. The standard librarys
of C and C++ have round functions that return floating point numbers. Rounding
in this library takes and returns 'Rational's and can round to a number of
significant digits or a number of decimal places.
